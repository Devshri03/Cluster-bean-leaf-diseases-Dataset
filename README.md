# Cluster-bean-leaf-diseases
Abstract
Cluster bean is a valuable crop and widely grown bean in many countries due to its significant culinary, industrial, and health benefits. It is primarily used in guar gum production, which is vital in various industries, supporting economic growth and sustainable agricultural practices. Given its significance, early and accurate prediction of cluster bean plant leaf diseases is essential for reducing crop losses and improving management. Recently, deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, have been utilized for creating crop disease detection and classification models, replacing traditional visual disease identification methods. A dataset is one of the most critical elements for disease prediction models. While many public datasets, like PlantVillage, PlantDoc, etc., exist for other crops, none were available specifically for cluster bean plant leaf diseases. We have therefore created a new dataset for "Leaf Diseases of Cluster Bean Plant." This dataset includes images collected from Gwalior and the surrounding region of Madhya Pradesh, India. The dataset encompasses a total number of 9249 images of cluster bean plants about thirteen different diseases such as Alternaria, Anthracnose, Bacterial Blight, and others. To enhance the model's generalizability, the dataset incorporates images captured under various environmental conditions, including different lighting, angles, and stages of leaf damage (half-leaf, texture changes, and color changes). We have performance a meta-analysis of various CNN-based deep learning models to this dataset, and the baseline results are being established. The "Diseases of Cluster Bean" dataset will be available at https://github.com/Devshri03/Cluster-bean-leaf-diseases.
